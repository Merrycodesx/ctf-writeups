# Dot And Next Line 
> Énoncé “Rien de trop est un point dont on parle sans cesse et qu’on n’observe point.”Jean de La Fontaine
## Solution
The challenge gives us an image file.

the image looks like an ad for a house for sale, not that helpful. But if you look at the challenge name is says dont and next line.
### Approach
1. Based on that clue , look at every dot in the page.
2. Then map every dot with the character directly above it. then you find the answer chatelet15h
