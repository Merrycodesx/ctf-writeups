# Wav   Noise Analysis

## Challenge Description
> A little bit music?

## Solution
This challenge give us a wav file.I tried to see hidden files inside but not very helpful.
### Approach
1. The audio is hard to understand what it's saying could be sped-up message so i tried to change the speed and listen to it. 

2. I used this online audio editor tool [wavacity](https://wavacity.com/)
3. open the challenge file(ctrl+O) then go to effect reverse it.
4. Still the audio is difficult to understand so then slowed it down a bit.
